Assumptions:

1. The travel times given are the average travel time of an optimal route which, by way of the 4-color proof, must occassionally pass through other zones.

2. For travel time within zones, we assume Normal Distributions of travel time from one area of a zone to a

3. Center is the center of population density

4. We can only place ambulances in the centers of zones
